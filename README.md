# ECE-276A_Orientation-Tracking-and-Panorama-Reconstruction
The objective of this project is to recover accurate roll, pitch, and yaw angles from IMU measurements by fusing complementary sensor information. I formulate the orientation estimation problem as a gradient-descent optimization and evaluate its performance by comparing the estimated orientations against the provided Vicon groundtruth data.
